# COVID-19 in Colombia: General Analysis and Visualization

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 situation in Colombia. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook, "COVID_19_In_Colombia_General_analysis_and_Visualization.ipynb," which includes data processing, statistical analysis, and visual representation of the COVID-19 data.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning and structuring COVID-19 data specific to Colombia.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights about the spread and impact of the virus.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating various charts and graphs to visually represent the data and findings.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifying trends in the data, such as infection rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** For data processing and analysis.
- **Libraries:** Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and other relevant Python libraries.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the analysis process and visualizations.
